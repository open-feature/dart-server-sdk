# OpenFeature Dart Client SDK

This package is the vendor-neutral OpenFeature SDK for Dart client
applications. It uses the static-context paradigm. It has no Flutter or
`dart:io` dependency.

The package is in beta. The first beta defines the public client and provider
contracts. It provides synchronous typed evaluation, event handlers, hooks,
ordered context changes, and an in-memory provider. Later beta changes will
complete the remaining conformance work before the first stable release.

## Use the client

```dart
import 'package:openfeature_dart_client_sdk/openfeature_dart_client_sdk.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final provider = InMemoryProvider({
    'new-checkout': true,
    'welcome-message': 'Hello',
  });

  await OpenFeatureAPI.instance.setProviderAndWait(provider);
  await OpenFeatureAPI.instance.setEvaluationContextAndWait(
    EvaluationContext(targetingKey: 'user-123'),
  );

  final client = OpenFeatureAPI.instance.getClient('checkout');
  final enabled = client.getBooleanValue('new-checkout', false);
  final message = client.getStringValue('welcome-message', 'Welcome');

  print('$enabled: $message');
  await OpenFeatureAPI.instance.shutdown();
}
```

## Implement a provider

Implement `FeatureProvider` with synchronous resolvers. A resolver must use
local state. It must not perform network, file, or platform-channel I/O.

Implement only the optional capabilities that the provider needs:

- `InitializableProvider` for asynchronous initialization.
- `ContextReconciliationProvider` for static-context changes.
- `ShutdownProvider` for resource cleanup.
- `ProviderEventSource` for provider lifecycle events.
- `DomainScopedProvider` when one provider instance supports one domain.
- `TrackingProvider` for non-blocking tracking.

An initializable or reconciling provider must also implement
`ProviderEventSource`. It must emit the terminal lifecycle event before its
method terminates. The SDK bounds lifecycle waits to 30 seconds by default so
a provider contract violation cannot indefinitely block context changes or
shutdown. Tests and isolated integrations may select a shorter timeout through
`createIsolatedOpenFeatureAPI(lifecycleTimeout: ...)`.

When initialization or context reconciliation times out, the SDK quarantines
and detaches that provider instance. Its underlying asynchronous work cannot be
cancelled safely, so applications must register a new provider instance rather
than retrying the timed-out one. Subscription cancellation and shutdown cleanup
are bounded by the same timeout.

A provider that implements `ContextReconciliationProvider` can have only one
active API/domain binding. Use a separate provider instance for each static
context. Providers that resolve entirely from the context passed to each
resolver and do not reconcile cached state may be shared across domains.

The package currently lives in the server SDK repository while the project
validates the beta. Its package name and Dart import path are independent; a
later repository move will be announced with migration guidance.

## Scope

This package does not include an HTTP transport, an OFREP provider, a vendor
provider, persistent storage, or Flutter APIs.

## Validate the package archive

The repository root uses `.pubignore` to keep client source out of the server
package. Pub also applies that parent rule to nested publication commands. Run
the repository staging command to validate the client archive outside the
parent package:

```text
dart tool/stage_client_package.dart --dry-run
```

See the
[beta release procedure](https://github.com/open-feature/dart-server-sdk/blob/main/doc/client-sdk-release.md)
for the first-publication bootstrap and later automated prereleases.

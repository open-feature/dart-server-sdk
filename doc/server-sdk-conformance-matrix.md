# Dart server SDK OpenFeature v0.9 conformance matrix

Status: maintainer proposal
Tracks: [#121](https://github.com/open-feature/dart-server-sdk/issues/121)
Specification baseline: [OpenFeature v0.9.0](https://github.com/open-feature/spec/releases/tag/v0.9.0)
Implementation baseline: lifecycle work proposed in #131

## Purpose and scope

This document maps the existing `openfeature_dart_server_sdk` package to the
OpenFeature v0.9 contract. It is an implementation plan and review aid, not a
claim of conformance.

The server SDK continues to use the dynamic-context paradigm. Flag evaluation
remains asynchronous, and API, transaction, client, invocation, and before-hook
contexts participate in evaluation. Static-context reconciliation belongs to
the separately proposed client SDK in #117 and is not imported into this
package.

The conformance work must preserve:

- the `openfeature_dart_server_sdk` package name and existing import paths;
- pure Dart operation with no Flutter dependencies;
- asynchronous server-side evaluation;
- invocation-scoped dynamic context;
- public compatibility through adapters and deprecations where practical.

Moving the server package under a future monorepo `packages/` directory and
renaming this repository to `dart-sdk` remain later compatibility changes. They
must not be bundled into the v0.9 behavioral implementation.

## Legend

| Mark | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Conformant | Implemented with relevant evidence; requirement-indexed tests may still be needed. |
| Partial | Partially represented, but the current behavior or public contract is not conformant. |
| Missing | Missing or materially incompatible. |
| N/A | Not applicable to the dynamic-context server paradigm. |

## P0: lifecycle and evaluation safety

These corrections establish safe provider replacement and deterministic
evaluation behavior before wider API cleanup.

| Area | v0.9 requirements | Current state and evidence | Required correction | Test gate | Compatibility approach |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider-owned lifecycle events | 1.1.2.4; 1.7.1-1.7.6; 2.8.1-2.8.5; 5.3.1-5.3.3 | Partial: new initialization capabilities require provider-owned ready/error events before termination, including normal asynchronous stream delivery. Resolver-only providers are ready without initialization events. Legacy eventful FeatureProvider implementations alone retain the one-second migration grace. | Retire the legacy grace only after provider migration; complete the canonical event API and requirement report in #162/#165. | provider_capabilities_test.dart covers event timing, missing/contradictory events, status-before-handler and resolver-only readiness. Existing provider_lifecycle_test.dart legacy grace and lifecycle tests pass. | ProviderInitialization couples initialization and event support. LegacyProviderLifecycleAdapter names the legacy-only synthesized-event and delivery-grace policy. |
| Provider status | 1.7.1-1.7.6; 2.8; 5.1.4-5.1.5 | Conformant for P0: status is maintained per provider instance, exposed on bound clients, updated before associated handlers, and normalized to `NOT_READY` after shutdown. `NOT_READY` and `FATAL` evaluations now short-circuit with their specified errors. | Reconcile the expanded legacy `ProviderState` enum with the five public v0.9 states during P1 API cleanup. | Passing status-transition, handler-observed status, shutdown, `NOT_READY`, and `FATAL` short-circuit tests. | Preserve legacy names internally while exposing one canonical public status contract. |
| Instance-aware provider binding | 1.1.2.1-1.1.2.3; 1.1.3; 1.1.8.1; 1.8.4 | Conformant for P0: the lifecycle manager tracks object identity independently from metadata name, reference-counts bindings, isolates same-name instances, and shuts a provider down only after its final binding is removed. Latest concurrent requests win, failed domain requests restore the prior pending binding, and domain-scoped providers reject a second domain. | Carry the focused replacement-race/concurrency evidence into the requirement-indexed P2 suite. | Passing same-name isolation, final-binding shutdown, concurrent default/domain replacement, failed-request rollback, legacy name-first activation, and domain-scoped rejection tests. | Provider names remain metadata; explicit provider IDs supply registry identity without removing legacy name-first binding yet. |
| Dynamic client rebinding | 1.1.3; 1.1.6-1.1.8; 1.2.2; 5.1.2-5.1.3 | Partial: existing clients now resolve current default/domain provider and status dynamically, including later provider replacement. Client metadata still lacks the immutable v0.9 domain field and event registration is not yet normalized. | Add immutable domain metadata and finish typed, dynamically isolated client events. | Existing-client replacement tests pass; metadata immutability, fallback, concurrent replacement, and typed-event gates remain. | Keep current client factory signatures temporarily; add domain metadata with a compatibility alias for the legacy name. |
| Evaluation defaults and failure contract | 1.3.1.1-1.3.4; 1.4.1.1-1.4.15.1; 2.2.1-2.2.10 | Partial: provider, before/after hook, and context-resolution failures are contained; `NOT_READY`/`FATAL` short-circuit without provider resolution; detailed errors preserve codes; absent flag metadata is now an immutable empty record. Evaluation methods still expose implicit false/empty defaults, and per-type error coverage is incomplete. | Require an application default on every simple and detailed evaluation, then complete per-type type-mismatch/parse/general failure evidence without reintroducing escaping exceptions. | Passing focused failure/default tests for boolean evaluation; required-signature and complete per-type gates remain. | Introduce required-default signatures through a staged API or new conformant methods, then deprecate implicit-default overloads. |
| Evaluation context integrity | 3.1.1-3.1.4; 3.2.1.1; 3.2.3 | Implemented at SDK boundaries: `EvaluationContext.immutable` validates and deeply snapshots evaluation fields; the old API context is a canonical-context adapter. Global, transaction, client, invocation and before-hook snapshots retain complete parent fields and targeting precedence. | Review the staged legacy-constructor policy in #159; complete hook API/order (#161) and experimental propagator lifecycle/independent API isolation (#163). Legacy const construction is not immediately immutable and remains explicitly outside that claim. | `context_regression_test.dart` reproduces three prior failures; `context_contract_test.dart` covers field types/access, deep copies, all five levels, hook-await mutation, late global replacement and overlapping transactions. | Keep the const constructor and positional-map adapter; add immutable construction and canonical global setters. See the package context migration guide before deprecation/removal. |

## P1: complete the public contract

| Area | v0.9 requirements | Current state and evidence | Required correction | Test gate | Compatibility approach |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider surface | 2.1.1; 2.2; 2.3; 2.4; 2.5; 2.7 | Implemented additively: Provider requires metadata and typed resolvers only. Initialization, shutdown, hooks and tracking are separate capabilities; initial global context and first domain are captured. Legacy FeatureProvider objects retain source compatibility and identity. | Review the capability naming/legacy policy in #160. Complete hook/options contracts (#161), API shutdown (#163), tracking details/nonblocking API (#164) and final evidence (#165). | provider_capabilities_test.dart: minimal implements-only provider, optional capabilities, context/domain, concurrent first binding, domain-scoped enforcement, strict lifecycle events, shutdown-once, hooks/tracking and legacy compatibility. Existing replacement-race tests pass. | API registration accepts Provider and caches an internal bridge per identity. Existing FeatureProvider and its old methods remain; see provider-capabilities-migration.md. |
| Hooks and evaluation options | 1.5.1; 2.3.1-2.3.3; 4.1-4.6 | Partial: API/client hooks and stages exist, and optional provider hooks now participate with a per-evaluation snapshot. Evaluation options, invocation hooks, supported-stage declarations, and fully immutable hints are missing. Custom priority ordering can conflict with specified registration order. | Add evaluation options and invocation hooks/hints. Complete provider-hook/options integration. Implement before ordering API -> transaction -> client -> invocation -> provider and reverse after/error/finally order, limited by supported stages. Keep hook data immutable. | Stage signature, merge contribution, ordering, short-circuit/error, supported-stage, hint immutability, and late registration tests. | Deprecate custom priority semantics if they cannot be mapped without violating specification order. |
| Event API and isolation | 5.1.1-5.1.5; 5.2.1-5.2.7; 5.3.1-5.3.5 | Missing: `open_feature_event.dart` and `event_system.dart` define competing event types. Handler registration consumes an untyped stream, and association relies on provider names rather than instances/domains. | Publish one canonical event model. Register/remove handlers by event type at API and client scope. Isolate delivery by provider instance and dynamic domain binding, include required event metadata, and prevent handler failures from disrupting others. | Typed registration/removal, API/client scope, same-name instance isolation, rebinding, metadata, status-before-handler, and handler-failure tests. | Adapt legacy streams to the canonical dispatcher during a deprecation window; do not keep two independent event buses. |
| API shutdown and reset | 1.6.1-1.6.2; 1.7.6; 2.5 | Partial: focused provider shutdown infers `NOT_READY` without fabricating a stale event, and singleton reset awaits resilient controller/lifecycle cleanup even when one operation fails. A conformant API-wide shutdown that invokes every registered provider and resets all API state is still missing. | Add API shutdown that shuts down every registered provider once, resets providers, contexts, hooks, event handlers, and transaction propagators, and leaves the API reusable in its initial state. | Multi-provider shutdown-once, idempotency, in-flight initialization cancellation, complete state reset, partial-cleanup failure, and reuse-after-shutdown tests. | Keep `shutdownProvider` as a deprecated focused helper if needed, implemented through the lifecycle coordinator. |
| Independent API instances | 1.8.1-1.8.4 | Missing: only the global singleton is publicly available. | Add a deliberately separate factory/module for independent API instances with isolated providers, contexts, hooks, handlers, and transaction propagation. | Cross-instance state, event, provider, hook, and shutdown isolation tests. | Preserve the default singleton as the normal entry point. |
| Tracking | 2.7.1; 6.1.1.1-6.1.4; 6.2.1-6.2.2 | Partial: client and provider tracking exist, but every provider must implement it; tracking value is `double?` rather than `num?`; context integrity and custom detail types are not fully enforced. | Make tracking a provider capability, merge the conformant context, accept the specified numeric value shape, validate allowed custom fields, and define behavior for providers without tracking support. | Tracking/no-tracking provider, context merge, targeting-key, integer/double value, custom-field type, and shutdown/flush tests. | Supply a legacy tracking adapter and deprecate the mandatory provider method. |
| Transaction context | 3.3.1.1-3.3.2.1 (experimental) | Partial: a transaction context manager exists, but it needs requirement-indexed evidence, explicit propagator lifecycle, and isolation validation. | Verify idiomatic async-zone propagation, API registration/removal, merge precedence, and reset on shutdown. Document experimental status. | Nested async zone, concurrent request isolation, precedence, missing propagator, and shutdown reset tests. | Preserve existing transaction APIs when their behavior is conformant; adapt names separately from semantics. |

## P2: conformance and migration evidence

| Deliverable | Required result | Merge gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requirement-indexed test suite | Each applicable v0.9 MUST has a passing test or a documented language/paradigm exception. SHOULD requirements have tests or recorded rationale. | CI publishes a matrix report tied to the v0.9 requirement identifiers. |
| Public API migration guide | Provider authors and SDK users can identify replacements, adapters, deprecations, and removal targets. | Examples cover provider events, provider replacement, contexts, hooks, events, tracking, and shutdown. |
| Package compatibility check | Existing package/import identity remains usable throughout the conformance stream. | A fixture using the last pre-conformance public API compiles against the compatibility layer. |
| External provider validation | At least one server provider passes lifecycle, evaluation, hook/event, and tracking integration scenarios without vendor logic entering core. | Validation runs in the provider's canonical repository and records the exact SDK prerelease/commit. A read-only mirror is not used as release or CI authority. |
| Documentation accuracy | README and API docs stop claiming v0.8 once the v0.9 gates pass and do not claim conformance earlier. | Published conformance statement links the tested matrix and specification release. |

## Explicitly non-applicable static-context requirements

The server package uses dynamic invocation context. The following v0.9
requirements are therefore not implementation targets for this package:

- 3.2.2.1-3.2.2.4: static-context API/domain context management;
- 3.2.4.1-3.2.4.2: automatic provider reconciliation after static context
  mutation;
- lifecycle behavior that exists only to reconcile a client-side evaluated flag
  cache after a static identity change.

The optional provider `on context changed` capability in 2.6.1 may still be
represented by a shared provider abstraction, but the dynamic server API must
not invoke it as a substitute for passing merged invocation context to every
evaluation.

## Implementation sequence

1. Land this matrix and agree on the legacy-provider compatibility boundary.
2. Complete: add focused lifecycle/status tests, provider events, and the
   instance-aware binding coordinator.
3. In progress: finish client metadata, required evaluation defaults, and the
   canonical immutable context model. The current provider-rebinding race suite
   passes, but complete requirement-indexed evaluation evidence remains open.
4. Normalize hooks, events, tracking, shutdown, and independent API instances.
5. Add the complete requirement-indexed suite and migration guide.
6. Publish a server SDK prerelease for external provider validation.
7. Treat monorepo relocation and repository renaming as later, independently
   reversible changes.

Each implementation PR should reference #121, identify the matrix rows it
closes, and avoid mixing client-SDK or repository-migration changes into the
server conformance diff.

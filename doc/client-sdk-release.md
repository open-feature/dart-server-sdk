# Dart Client SDK Beta Release

The Dart client SDK is independently versioned from the server SDK. Client
changes use the `openfeature_dart_client_sdk-v<version>` tag format and must not
require a server package release. Release Please opens separate component pull
requests so maintainers can merge the client release without publishing the
server package. Both SDKs live under `packages/`, so Release Please can scope
each proposal to the package directory that owns the change.

## Bootstrap release set

The repository-layout migration after server `v0.0.23` deliberately requires
one server repackaging release, `0.0.24`, alongside the first client beta release
proposal. This is a one-time migration decision rather than a coupling between
the two package versions. Release Please must still open separate server and
client release pull requests, and maintainers may review and merge them
independently.

Before merging the generated server `0.0.24` release pull request, curate its
changelog to describe the server package move and the required Git dependency
`path: packages/openfeature_dart_server_sdk`. Remove client-scoped changes and
repository-only DCO or branch-sync entries from the server changelog. The full
migration instructions remain in `doc/repository-layout-migration.md`.

Release Please owns both package changelogs. Before the first client release,
the client changelog contains only a non-rendered bootstrap marker mentioning
`0.0.1-beta.1`, which keeps the package dry-run warning-free while allowing the
generated entry to be the first visible heading. Do not prewrite that version
heading. The server changelog must not carry an `Unreleased` block above its
generated version entries.

## First pub.dev publication

Automated pub.dev publishing can be configured only after a package exists.
For `0.0.1-beta.1`, an authorized OpenFeature publisher must:

1. Merge the reviewed client beta promotion to `main`.
2. In the generated client release PR, remove the one-time `release-as` setting
   from `release-please-config.json`. The repository test suite deliberately
   rejects a non-bootstrap manifest that retains this override. Verify that the
   PR still proposes `0.0.1-beta.1`, then merge it. Release Please updates the
   manifest from `0.0.0` and creates the
   `openfeature_dart_client_sdk-v0.0.1-beta.1` tag.
3. Check out that exact tag and run:

   ```text
   dart tool/stage_client_package.dart --dry-run
   dart tool/stage_client_package.dart --publish
   ```

4. Transfer the package to the verified `openfeature.dev` publisher on pub.dev.
5. Configure pub.dev automated publishing for this GitHub repository and the
   `openfeature_dart_client_sdk-v*` tag pattern.
6. Set the GitHub repository variable `CLIENT_PUBDEV_BOOTSTRAPPED` to `true`.

Until the repository variable is enabled, client release tags deliberately
print bootstrap instructions instead of silently attempting publication.

## Later prereleases

Release Please tracks the client from `packages/openfeature_dart_client_sdk`
and creates component-prefixed beta tags. The tag-triggered publish workflow
stages the package before publishing so the validated archive is identical to
the archive used for the manual first-publication bootstrap.

The package-local `.release-please-version` file and the generic marker on the
pubspec version keep prerelease suffixes intact; Release Please's Dart updater
treats a hyphenated prerelease suffix as Dart build metadata.

Before every client release, verify formatting, analysis, tests, Dart web
compilation, the staged pub.dev dry-run, and at least one external provider
against the exact release commit.

# To ensure long-term stability and maintain high standards of code quality,
# we include only packages from well-known providers and official Dart and Google sources.
# Specifically, packages are selected from the following trusted publishers:
# - Google packages: https://pub.dev/publishers/google.dev/packages
# - Official Dart team packages: https://dart.dev/resources/dart-team-packages

# This approach minimizes risks associated with unverified dependencies and guarantees
# consistent support and updates from reputable maintainers.

# Package names are alphabetized
